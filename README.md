# React Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to the React Tic-Tac-Toe game! This is a simple yet fun implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using React.js. The game features a clean and responsive design, and allows two players to take turns marking the spaces in a 4X4 grid. The player who succeeds in placing four of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
